# so to start the notes we will be considering the online shopping case
## lets start!!
### some files are on the basic level, no notes required


# about the discount_product_2.py file
here we upgraded our logic and added some of the condition statments, 

# about the discount_product_3.py file
this is the upgraded version of the previous one
data for mobile and shoe are mixed up in the same code
to make changes in the logic for purchasing the shoes we have to modify that has logic for both shoes and mobiles. For example, if we have to add 'material' to the shoe and have a 5% on 'leather' shoes, then we have to gi through code related to mobile as well.
# discount_problem_4.py is the other improvement
here in this program we will be introducing the modular programming
main function will be divied into 2 functions each one having 2 parameters
it is explpained in the python file



# problem is now increasing and it is being complex
lets start upgrading the program in version 5 i.e discount_problem_5.py
we will add a facility to return the products as well, during return, refund amount should be displayed

### How do we go about displaying the refund amount? One way is to recalculate as defined in version 4. Here, price calculation logic is repeated in purchase as well as in return functions. This obviously is a bad idea.
