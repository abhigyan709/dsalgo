# Understanding pass by reference!

## what will happen if we will pass an object as a parameter of a function

### see code: pass_by_reference.py

when we pass an object as a parameter of a function, the parameter name becomes a reference-variable

there is one object with two reference variable, one the formal parameter and the actual parameter. Thus any change made through one reference variable will affect the other as well.
