# so we are done with the modular programming
## we added features 
### complexity of program increased 
program became much complex so, 
1. We can see that with our current style of programming, we quickly run into complications trying to simulate real world scenarios, 
2. like purchasing and returning a product.

The problem arises due to the fact that in real life everything has some data/characteristic associated with it and some behavior associated with it and we are not able to replicate this in a code. For example:

All mobiles have price and brand as its data and purchase and return as its behavior.

All shoes have price and material as its data and purchase and return as its behavior.

We need a way of programming which allows to club together the data and behavior so that it becomes easier to code real world scenarios.
